            What's changed over time?
        </h3>
        <p>Originally, CPUs had a single processing core. Today’s modern CPUs consists of multiple cores that allow it to perform multiple instructions at once, effectively cramming several CPUs on a single chip. Almost all CPUs sold today are at least dual-core, but at the higher end, you’ll see four (quad) core CPUs, and even six, eight, 10, 12, and 16-core CPUs in some cases. </p>
        <p>Some processors also employ a technology called multithreading. Imagine a single physical CPU core that can perform two lines of execution (threads) at once, thereby appearing as two “logical” cores on the operating system end. These virtual cores aren’t as powerful as physical cores, but they do share the same resources. Overall, they can help improve the CPU’s multitasking performance when running compatible software. </p>
        <p>Clock speed is another number that’s highly advertised with CPUs — the “gigahertz” (GHz) figure quoted on product listings. It effectively denotes how many instructions a CPU can handle per second, but that’s not the whole picture regarding performance. Clock speed mostly comes into play when comparing CPUs from the same product family or generation. When all else is the same, a faster clock speed means a faster processor, but a 3GHz processor from 2010 isn’t going to be as fast as a 2GHz processor from 2018. </p>
        <p>So, how much should you pay for a CPU? Well, unless you’re a hardcore gamer or someone looking to edit photos or videos, <b>you don’t need to spend more than $200</b>. Stick to a recent generation. For Intel CPUs that means eighth, ninth, or 10th-generation chips. You can determine their generation by the product name. For instance, the Core i7-6820HK is an older sixth-generation chip while the Core i5-10210U is a newer tenth-generation chip. AMD does something similar with its Ryzen CPUs: The Ryzen 5 2500X is a second-generation chip based on its new “Zen” core design while the Ryzen 9 3950X is a third-generation CPU.</p>
        <h3>intel®; the spark that started it all!</h3>

        <h3>The Conclusion:</h3>
        <p>As you can see from that video, intel® has been making CPUs for auite a long time now. In fact, they have been at the leading forefront of CPU manufactuing for as long as CPU manufacturing has been around! The intel 4004 cpu with a whopping 640 bytes of memory adressing capabilities, and 60,000 operations per second; it would be practically useless nowadays, but it was all the rave in the tech community back in 1971.</p>
