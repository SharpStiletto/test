        <h3>
            How important is the CPU?
        </h3>
        <p>Although the CPU isn’t as important for overall system performance as it once was, it still plays a major role in running a device. Since it is solely responsible for executing commands within programs, the faster your CPU, the faster many applications run.
        That said, a fast CPU isn’t everything. A processor, no matter how powerful, can’t easily render the latest 3D games, nor can it store information. That’s where other components, like graphics cards and memory, come into play.</p>
        <p>In short, the CPU isn’t everything, but it’s highly important. In general, a faster CPU will mean that your system or device will run faster. At the very least it won’t be a bottleneck in its own right. Multiple cores and threads can also help you do more things at once.</p>

        <h3>
            What does a CPU actually do?
        </h3>
        <p>At its core, a CPU takes instructions from a program or application and performs a calculation. This process breaks down into three key stages: Fetch, decode, and execute. A CPU fetches the instruction from Random Access Memory (RAM), decodes what the instruction actually is, and then executes the instruction using relevant parts of the CPU.</p>
        <p>The executed instruction, or calculation, can involve basic arithmetic, comparing certain numbers together, or moving them around in memory. Since everything in a computing device is represented by numbers, those simple tasks equate to what a CPU does. It’s what facilitates everything from starting up Windows, to watching a YouTube video.</p>
        <p>In modern systems, the CPU doesn’t do everything, but it still must feed to specialized hardware the numbers they need to function. It needs to tell the graphics card to show an explosion because you clicked on a fuel barrel (whoops), or tell your hard drive to transfer an Office document to the system’s RAM for quicker access.</p>

        <h3>How Should I pick my CPU?</h3>
        <p>Based off of what we've already covered, theres a couple main things you need to consider:</p>
        <span>
        <ul class="small-list">
            <li>How much money are you willing to spend?</li>
            <li>How fast do you want your computer to be?</li>
            <li>Are you looking for top of the line hardware?</li>
        </ul>
        </span>
        <p>Taking all those into consideration, you should spend some proper time looking into what CPU would best fit your needs; and keep a cost/value model in mind. Nowadays, it's most likely your CPU will be from a big name like intel® or AMD®, because they have built their reputation off having good dependable products up over the years; however, if you choose to get a CPU from some other source, you may want to double check everyything about it before you make the purchase, because refunds and warranties aren't always available.</p>
