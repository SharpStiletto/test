      An Overview of CPUs
    </h2>
    <p>
      CPUs, or Central Processing Units, are responsible for processing and
      executing instructions. As it states in the name, the CPU would certainly
      fall under the processing category; as well, it's probably the most
      important piece of processing hardware in the entire computer. By reading
      through the rest of this site, you'll find out how CPUs interact with
      other parts of your devices and what makes them so integral to the
      computing process.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What makes a CPU a CPU?
    </h3>
    <p>The CPU is the core component of what defines a computing device, it’s the
    brains. It’s a chip that sits in a special spot (socket) located on the
    main circuit board (motherboard or mainboard) inside the device. It’s
    distinctly separate from the memory, which is where it temporarily stores
    information. It’s also separate from the graphics card or graphics chip,
    which renders all video and 3D graphics displayed on your screen.</p> 
    <p>CPUs are built by placing billions of microscopic transistors onto a single
    computer chip. Those transistors allow it to make the calculations it
    needs to run programs that are stored on your system’s memory. They’re
    effectively tiny gates that switch on or off, thereby conveying the ones
    or zeros that translate into everything you do with the device, be it
    watching videos, or writing an email.</p>
    <p>One of the most common advancements of CPU technology is in making those transistors smaller and smaller.
    That’s resulted in the improvement to CPU speed over the decades, often
    referred to as
    <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mooreslaw.asp"
    >Moore’s Law.</a
    >
    In the context of modern devices, a desktop or laptop has a dedicated CPU
    that performs many processing functions for the system. Mobile devices and
    some tablets instead utilize a System on Chip (SoC) which is a chip that
    contains its CPU alongside other components. Intel and AMD both offer CPUs
    with graphics chips and memory stored on them too, meaning they can do
    more than just standard CPU functions.</p>
