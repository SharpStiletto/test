            <p>These transistors are what are used in microprocessors and memory. They take less power then BJTs but are made in the exact same way.</p>
            <p>All this work is done in 'clean rooms', as even the smallest particle of dust can ruin a whole chip! The workers wear 'bunny suits' to keep dust and skin particales from getting into the air.</p>

            <p>These days much of the process is automated, so the technicians have to monitor many sophisticated machines.</p>

            <p>A fabrication lab (fab) requires large amounts of infrastructure to deal with all the chemicals, high temperatures, and pressures used inside.</p>
